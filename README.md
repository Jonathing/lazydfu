# LazyDFU

LazyDFU makes the DFU lazy, blah blah blah. You probably already know what it is if you found this fork.

Here's where you'll probably want to be if you're here by accident:

- [Original LazyDFU mod for Fabric by tuxed](https://github.com/astei/lazydfu)
- [CorgiTaco's Forge port of LazyDFU](https://github.com/CorgiTaco/lazydfu)

## Fork by Jonathing

I made this fork of the Forge port because I thought it could use some cleaning up, and before the 1.17.1 update existed for CorgiTaco's fork, I had updated it to 1.17.1 myself. Unfortunately my PR into his repo never got any sort of reply, so I closed it and am now maintaining this fork on my own. It won't be on CurseForge, but every release will be in the GitHub Releases page which is probably on the right side of the webpage.

Here's what you'll need to know

- The 1.17.1 file is for Minecraft 1.17.1 and above. It should hopefully work for versions above 1.17.1 as well. It also works with FMLOnly since it's only a single coremod, which is pretty nifty.
- The 1.14.4 file is for Minecraft 1.14.4 all the way through 1.16.5.
- The 1.14.3 file is for Minecraft 1.14.3 and some early versions of Forge for Minecraft 1.14.4.
- The 1.13.2 file is for Minecraft 1.13.2 through some early versions of Forge for Minecraft 1.14.3.
- If you want the specifics on what works with what version, just read the `mods.toml` file in the file you want to work with.

That's all. Now shoo.
